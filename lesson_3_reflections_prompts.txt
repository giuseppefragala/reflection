Q - When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
A - It's useful for developing on different machine then the one you use usally, or in general from different place. Other people can partecipate to your work in this way as well.

Q - Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
A - You would not wont push and then share all your local commits.

Q - Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
A - Fork is used in GitHub interface to create a copy of an existing repository of a GitHub user to another Github user.
    Clone gets a copy of a repository, from GitHub to a local Git.
    Branch is  the command given to create a local copy of another local repository.

Q - What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
A - You can check and, possibly, try to resolve conflicts.

Q - How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
A - Without using Git or GiHtub I can collaborate by the other media used so far (file sharing, email, telephon call).
	With few files project it could be easier sharing changes and resolve conflicts generated within them.
	In general, on project involving many developers, it would be hard to keep track of single developer work, resolve conflict and constructively share their own changes.

Q - When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?
A - It's more convenient try all experimental or new feature in separate branche. In this way you can avoid to demage master branch in case of too much extreme experimentations.
