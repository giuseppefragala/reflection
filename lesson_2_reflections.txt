Q - What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
A - Git creates a hidden directory in which are stored all Git need to work. I need to do it because without the folder is a normal file system folder.

Q - How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
A - The staging area contains only the files added in it. It is a good way to prepare the file involved with the next commit.
